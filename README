MICE TOF Calibration Utility
################################################

This document describes the procedure for running the MICE TOF calibration on the onrec control-room computers.

The calibration code and run scripts are installed in onrec01:~/tof_calibration

------------------------------------------------

The contents of this directory are:
a) calib.cpp MiceTofCalib.cc[hh], TofT0Calib.cc[hh], TofTriggerCalib.cc[hh], TofTWCalib.cc[hh] --> Source code

b) CMakeLists.txt --> file for running cmake

c) tofcalib_cards.txt --> Data cards for the calibration
The cards control the following parameters
-- the trigger station, 
   -- default is 1 (i.e. tof1), if trigger on tof2 for eg., change it to 2
-- the z distance between the stations, 
-- and the location of the most populated pixels, 

d) run_tof_calib.sh --> The script to run the calibration

NOTE: Do not edit the code or the CMakeLists unless you know what you are doing.

------------------------------------------------
Before running the calibration first verify a couple of things:

1. Make sure the ReduceCppTofCalib reducer was run during data-taking

The reducer produces a ROOT file tofcalibdata_NNNN.root, where
  -- NNNN = Run Number, for e.g. tofcalibdata_4993.root

This ROOT file which be be the input to the calibration program

This ROOT file then gets moved to $MAUS_WEB_MEDIA_RAW
[--- NOTE: ---- I think this is not happening right now, so look for the tofcalibdata_????.root files in the 
  directory from which the reducer was run ]

If everything went well, the tofcalibdata_NNNN.root should be in 
$MAUS_WEB_MEDIA_RAW

Check to make sure:
  ls -l $MAUS_WEB_MEDIA_RAW

If you do not see the tofcalibdata.root file in that directory, something likely went wrong. 
Here are some things you can check:

a) look at the log from online reconstruction and verify it succeeded.
b) if the reconstruction ran, check if tofcalibdata_???.root exists in the directory 
the online reconstruction was run from; perhaps it failed to get moved to $MAUS_WEB_MEDIA_RAW
c) if you are unsure, contact an expert

------------------------------------------------
2. After verifying 
  a) cd to the MAUS installation directory
  b) source env.sh
  c) cd ~/tof_calibration

Now you are ready to run the calibration:
$ pwd 
to make sure you are in ~/tof_calibration

------------------------------------------------
3. ./run_tof_calib.sh

[ See 3.b if you want to specify the ROOT file on the command line ]
The script will put out some informationals as it proceeds
If all goes well the script will produce the following calibration files:
- tofTWcalib.txt
- tofTriggercalib.txt
- tofT0calib.txt
Take a look or have an expert look at these files before uploading to CDB
One thing to quickly look for in the files is whether there are too many 0s or -9999s
These indicate slabs/pixels with failed calibrations. 
------------------------------------------------

3.b Input ROOT via command line argument

By default, the script will expect a file named tofcalibdata.root in MAUS_WEB_MEDIA_RAW

If instead, you wish to use a different file name or a different path, you can supply it as 
the first argument to this script

./run_tof_calib.sh /path/to/filename.root

You will be prompted to confirm. Answer and proceed.

------------------------------------------------
4. The script can fail for the following reasons:

i. MAUS_ROOT_DIR was not set
-- Solution: cd to the MAUS installation area; run `source env.sh` and return here and try again

ii. Could not find tofcalibdata.root
-- Possible causes: the ReduceCppTofCalib reducer was not run or it failed
-- Solution: Check the online reconstruction logs for any failures, and make sure the reducer is run

iii. tofcalibdata.root is empty
-- Possible causes: bad data, tof digit/slab hits reconstruction failed, other bug
-- Solution: contact a TOF reconstruction expert

------------------------------------------------

5. Calibration ran but the output txt files are sparsely populated or empty.
- Symptom: a lot of '0's or -9999s in the tof*calib.txt files, 

-- Possible cause 1: not enough statistics in the pixels
-- Solution: take more data, or reduce the required minimum number of entries.
To reduce the minimum number of entries
a) edit the data cards file -> tofcalib_cards.txt
b) look for min_entries_tw, min_entries_trig, min_entries_t0 and lower them
c) save the file
d) ./run_tof_calib.sh

-- Possible cause 2: improper choice of central pixels
-- Solution: 
a) find the x,y pixels with the most statisics 
- To do this, look at the Slab hits histograms from the online histogramming
- Identify the most populated x & y slabs
b) edit the data card file --> tofcalib_cards.txt
c) find the keys: tof0_sXmax...tof2_sYmax
d) the values for these keys are the 'maximum' x & y pixels in TOF0,1,2
e) change the values appropriately
f) save the file
g) ./run_tof_calib.sh
